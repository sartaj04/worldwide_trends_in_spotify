# Music Track Popularity and Region Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the popularity and region of music tracks using various machine learning models. The analysis involves two main aspects: popularity prediction and region prediction. The popularity is assessed using both regression models and binary classification, while region prediction utilizes classification models.

## Repository Structure
- **Popularity.ipynb**: This notebook includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Dimensionality Reduction, and Popularity Prediction using various machine learning models.
- **Region.ipynb**: Focuses on predicting the region associated with each music track using classification techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the code and results.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Includes scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.

## Getting Started
To run these notebooks and explore the predictions:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, along with Jupyter Notebook. The required Python libraries can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
